                    Good Books for Programmers
                    --------------------------

I've been asked to suggest some good books (why? Isn't howtocode
good enough? ;-)

Hardware Reference Manual
-------------------------
Essential for demo and game coders.

Rom Kernal Manual: Libraries
----------------------------
Essential for *ALL* Amiga Programmers

Rom Kernal Manual: Devices
--------------------------
Essential if you plan to do any work with Device IO (input.device,
timer.device, trackdisk.device, etc...)

Rom Kernal Manual: Includes & Autodocs
--------------------------------------
These are available on disk instead, which is a lot cheaper!
Essential reference work,

All these books are available to developers on the CATS CD 2 as
AmigaGuide files.. $50 from CATS US.

Amiga User Interface & Style Guide
----------------------------------
Probably the most boring book I've ever read :-) Useful if you
intend to write applications, but even then some of the rules have
changed for V39 since this book was printed.

AmigaDOS manual 3rd Edition (Bantam)
------------------------------------
Truly awful book, unfortunately the ONLY official dos.library
reference. Why it can't be integrated into the RKM's I don't know...
If you need to program dos.library and want info on AmigaDos file
and hunk formats, this is the book.

Mapping the Amiga (Compute)
---------------------------
One of my favourite books. This is an easy-to-read reference
to all system (1.3) functions and structures. Much easier to
use than the Includes & Autodocs. I wish there was a V39 update
to this!

Amiga System Programmers Guide (Abacus)
---------------------------------------
Quite handy, it covers a lot of the Hardware Reference manual,
Rom Kernal Manuals and more in one book, but I'd suggest you
buy the official books instead.

Advanced Amiga System Programmers Guide (Abacus)
------------------------------------------------
Slightly more interesting than the first one, covers mainly
OS level programming, but again nothing really new.

Amiga Disk Drives Inside and Out (Abacus)
-----------------------------------------
AVOID THIS BOOK! It has some of the worst code and coding practices
I have ever seen in it. Half of the code will only work under
Kickstart 1.2, the other half doesn't work at all!!!!

Amiga Realtime 3d Graphics (Sigma)
----------------------------------
Wow! What a useful book! Explains how to do vector graphics
in 68000 on the Amiga, from basics to complex world models with
lightsourcing. I haven't tried any of the code from the book
yet, but it looks very good.

680x0 Programming by Example (Howard Sams & Company)
----------------------------------------------------
Excellent book on 68000 programming. Covers 68000/020/030
instructions, optimization. Aimed at the advanced 68000 user,
some really neat stuff in this book. The only 68000 book I've
bought, except the Motorola manual.

Motorola User's Manuals (Prentice Hall?)
--------------------------------------------------
Explains most things you'd ever wish to know about your
processor, and worth gold when trying to estimate
cycles used by your code and what commands there are
and everything. Thanks to ITT Multikomponent for giving
me the mc68030 User's Manual for free (why?).

The Discworld Series (Terry Pratchett)
--------------------------------------
Nothing to do with Amigas, but excellent books. If you need
a break from programming, or just inspiration for impossible
things to have in an impossible demo, read one of these!
