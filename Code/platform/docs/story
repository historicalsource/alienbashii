game_intro


scene - squiz walks on surfboard under arm with shades on
	at the other end of the screen is a little animal named
	clover (bunny rabbit) who is crying
	
	

Squiz	- Hey Clover I have just had the most amazing holiday.

Clover	- ....Boo Hoo.....

Squiz 	- Oh man you should have seen the beaches - mile upon
	- mile of sunbathing chicks....goats....hamsters.....
	
Clover	- Boo Hoo.

Squiz    - ...and the waves - jeez you should have seen me 
	   Clover I rode those beasts like a true king.....
	   
Clover	- Its all gone..gone


Squiz	- ...and the food....

Clover	- ...all gone...Boo hoo

Squiz	- ..but the nightlife was the best - clubbing all night....

Clover	-  ...boo...hoooo...

Squiz	- Whats the matter Clover?

Clover	- The forest and all our friends, there all gone...

Squiz	- All gone what do you mean.

Clover	- Someone called the Demon king came and took all
	  our friends the forest guardians - Daisy,
	  Petal, Tuffty, Dinky, Ewen, Thomas, Squeaky and
	  even Porky
	  
	  tulip .
	  
Squiz	- But why?

Clover	- Who knows - to gain complete control of the land
	  most probably, all the locations have been 
	  strewn with his henchmen and booby traps. The
	  last few remaining animals are very hostile - they
	  are hanging on to what they have got left.

Squiz 	- Well...I'm not going to let this happen....

Clover	- I don't think you'll be able to do this on your own Squiz

Squiz	- Oh yeah - this ain't no ordinary Squirrel your talking too	
	   you know - Ive got the biggest nuts out of all the Squirrels
	   in the forest!
	   
Clover	- Thats all very well Squiz but I think it may be just as well
	  to try and get help from the remaining free creatures..if
	  they will give it.
	  
Squiz	- And how am i supposed to do that?

Clover	- I'm sure you will find a way Squiz.

Squiz  	- And what about you Clover - will you aid me in my quest.

Clover	- Oh..I'd love to Squiz but I twisted my paw - sorry no 
	  way can't hardly move it - oooooh look i've just lost all
	  feeling in it again...tell you what i'll pop up every 
	  now and again just to make sure your ok.
	  
Squiz	- Thanks...I won't hold my breath.

Clover	- Oh Squiz...

Squiz	- Yeah?

Clover	- Lose the shades.
