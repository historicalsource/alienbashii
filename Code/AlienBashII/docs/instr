General
-------

Alien Bash II will work on a A500, A600, A1200 onwards. A500, 600
owners lose out on some sound effects and the visual effects will
be less impressive (e.g tunnel on instructions, rain/snow etc).
However the general speed of the game is largely unaffected as I
have tried to balence it all - there is nothing I hate more than
playing a game on the 1200 and then trying it on my 500 and finding
that it runs twice as slowly!!!


Installing the Game on Hard Disk
--------------------------------

This is simple - just copy all the files from the disk into a directory.
Non Workbench 2.0 owners will have to move into the directory before
running the game, whereas others can simply click the icon.


Additional Instructions
-----------------------

THERE ARE 3 CONTROL METHODS!!!!

I stress this 'cos everyone complains about the default one without
realising that they can change it mid-game - please read the
instructions in the game as it gives all the keyboard and joystick
functions.
Note: You can quit the game by pressing 'ESC' on the title screen, and
I have added a keyboard reading facility to the high score table.


Dont Blame Us
-------------

We are sorry for the lack of variety in the levels - we have tried
out best to make them varied - but this game turned out a little too
big for us - the maps are horribly complicated to create - the maptool
took me 3 months to write!!!
