QUESTION: Please do not change the source a bit and say YOU made it. If you
like to see some new features write me...

*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*

This is version 0.1 of IFF 2 RAW. The following features are currently
available:

	- decrunch and write pictures. ( logical :)
	  (I2R can only convert IFF to plane RAW (yet))
	- make a copperlist for use in your code.

In future versions the following should be included :

	- display of the picture :)
	- interleaved raw
	- grabbing a part of an image
	- sprite grabbing
	- full support for all machines
	- full support for all graphics modes
	- ASCII copperlist for inclusion in source
	- ability to make copperlists for OCS, ECS and AGA (and AAA ? :)
	- improved IFF handling. (EA: send me some info please...)
	- a nice user interface

How to use it (Or more precise, what does/can it do ?)

I2R is a converter for IFF pictures. AGA IFF that is ! I needed such a program
to be able to use 8 bitplanes pictures on my A1200. So I decided to make one
by myself. (I had this idea earlier allready because my favorite convertor did
not work on kick 2.0 and higher.) If I had to wait for one, I would have a new
AAA machine allready and the new convertor was useless on it !

Ok, currently this program is very limited (that's why v0.1) but I hope to
release a new version real soon. This version will convert any picture but I
don't know the result of for example HAM8 pictures. I don't know yet, how to
handle the HAM8 mode. Also other modes are hocus pocus for me. As soon as I
have found the the proper ways (Commodore ?) the new things will be included.
Another limitation is that I2R is only able to save a copperlist for AGA with
256 colors. So if you have a picture of 128 colours...well, too bad ! You'll
get a 256 colour copperlist. (But you are still able to use it :)

How to use it ? Easy, just click twice on the I2R icon and pop ! Open window.
I2R will ask you for a IFF file to load (I know, maybe reqtools will be used
in v0.2+ untill the final version is finished). After loading and decrunching
a prompt will ask you for a new name to save the RAW file and the copperlist.
The copperlist will have the extension '.cop'. This is a binary file so you
have to use a incbin. Soon, also ASCII copperlist will be supported.
Easy isn't it ?

To use the RAW data and copperlist in your source take a look in the supplied
example source.

Last message :

Please DO send bug reports and ideas to the address stated above even if you
think 'that's not so important for me' or 'somebody else has probably written
about this bug allready'. Also sources of how to handle different AGA modes
are offcourse welcome. Help me make this the ultimate (and compatible with all
machines :) convertor.
