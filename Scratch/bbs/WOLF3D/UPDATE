+ Here's an executable with source of an alphaware Wolfenstien clone.
+ This archive is an update. It now includes:
+ - Runs under workbench 1.3/1.2
+ - Uses the mouse/joystick for movement
+ - The view is source scalable (change asm_lib and global.h VIEW_ values
+   to get a new view)
+ - includes executables for a 256x128 view, and a 128x64 view.
+ - includes the original C version of AsmRenderWorld for documentation purposes.
+
+ Requires: An any Amiga (I hope) computer.
